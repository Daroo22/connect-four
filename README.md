# Connect-Four Game

Welcome to the Connect 4 game! This is a web-based version of the classic Connect 4 board game, where players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The goal is to be the first to get four of your discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## How to play

Choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. Try to create 4 in a row of your own color vertically, horizontally or diagonally. You can block your opponent from getting 4 in a row by putting your own disc in.
